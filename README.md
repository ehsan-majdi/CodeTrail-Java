# CodeTrail-Java

This project contains various algorithmic challenges and solutions implemented in Java. It is designed as a practice repository for learning and mastering key programming concepts, including sorting, searching, and data manipulation.

## Features

- **Odd and Even Separation**: Identify and separate odd and even numbers from a list.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement selection sort to sort lists in ascending or descending order.
- **Merge Lists**: Combine odd and even lists into a single merged list.
- **Find Min and Max**: Determine the smallest and largest values in a combined list.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently search for a target value in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm.
- **Recursive Algorithms**: Explore the power of recursion with advanced problem-solving techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:
- **sorting**: Contains implementations for sorting algorithms.
- **searching**: Includes binary search and other searching methods.
- **utilities**: Provides helper methods like merging and finding min/max values.
